# TODO
Low priority TODOs

## general
- init?  __all__ = ["...", "..."]
- make packages per module?
- `from wwiser import ...` vs `from . import ...`?
- fix todo-s 
- os.path.join(dir, name) instead od dir + name

## parser
- support Shadowrun, Too Human
- some params names missing (ex. RTPCs)
- clean bitflags in parser (some change between versions)
- make as list: uNumSrc, srcID/etc, Children, etc
- v36<= eTransitionMode/_bIsUsingWeight etc recheck

## model
- 'var' type may go over omax, should adjust max loops
- attr list may return non-ordered to speed-up find()?

## gui
- show ico https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18537918/why-isnt-ico-file-defined-when-setting-windows-icon
- show viewer open status (change text to "reopen?" "running")
- viewer on another thread?
- add more options to generator

## view
- use BaseHTTPServer in python2?
- check if port is open (may open 2 instances and only 1 server works, but there is no port error)
- improve threading/pool? (not too useful as doesn't have that many resources)
- maybe move preloads to globals, auto init, recreate node printer every time
- divide readme and print multiple docs? (selectable links on top)
- print rebuilder nodes in simple mode (test with CAkSound), use templates to print to .html
- button to hide generic/useless stuff? (PositioningParams, AdvSettingsParams, etc)
- add combo with all common HIRC types
- links: if not found/loaded call bank and load sid id

## names
- parse json/bank xml metadata (not generated by default so uncommon)
- add key per game so wwnames can contain everything

## rebuilder
- improve internal init

## txtp
- option to hide marks {r} {s} {!} (instead of mark banks?)
- unsure if txtp should round up numbers: 1/48000 ~= 0.0000208333 * 48000 = 0.999999 > 1 or 0?
- overlapped transitions
  - needs fades (games use fading transition to smooth out loops)
  - next segment and looping to itself may have different transitions
  - randoms also need transitions from A to B/C/D/E/F to G
- transition objects in mranseq (Polyball)
- clean values that don't make samples, `#r 1.5000000000000002`
- resampler for demo music, pokemon, sor4
- apply transition delays: fTransitionTime in all ranseqs, TransitionTime, etc
- recheck TTime in earlier games (ex. Trine 2)
- fix multiloops: calc max by padding+body+loops of max branch
- DelayTime/InitialDelay may not work correctly with loops (ex. John Wick Hex 2932040671)
- simplify nodes when testing for dupes? (ex Bayonetta 2)
- apply default bus volumes for better results? (ex. Astral Chain, Gunslinger Stratos)
- mark loop inside inner group (double loop) as multiloop (ex. DmC last boss)
- use bankid for internals when possible instead of auto-using current+any bank?
- giant playlist + random + wem name options: only write selected wem (ex. Tony Hawk Shred Wii)
